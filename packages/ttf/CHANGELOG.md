### Patch Changes

- 7b9ac82: Strip the `development` export condition from the published manifest. The condition points at `src/`, which is not part of the tarball, so any consumer whose bundler matched it — Vite matches `development` in dev mode by default — failed with "Failed to resolve entry for package". The condition still drives src-resolution inside the monorepo; `prepack` now removes it from the manifest that lands in the tarball and `postpack` restores the original file.
